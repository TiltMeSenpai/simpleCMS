<p>So, I deployed this site to Heroku, then realized that because of the way I wrote it, I need posts for anything to work. Not exactly robust design, but easily fixed.<br/></p>
<p>Since I've been working on this for the past week, I might as well make this post useful and talk about the technology behind it and why I decided to write an entire CMS (Although a pretty simple one).<br/></p>
<h2>Tornado</h2>
<p>Tornado is a non-blocking server and asynchronous networking library written in Python. So, what exactly does that mean?
<ul>
    <li><h4>Non-Blocking:</h4>According to Stack Overflow, in a blocking webserver, the server serves each request before accepting the next. In most cases, this is the behavior achieved, however, in some cases, a request may take a while to serve. In these cases, a non-blocking server becomes useful, as the server can move on to handle the next request while waiting for some aspect of the current request to complete</li>
    <li><h4>Asynchronous:</h4>Also according to Stack Overflow, in a synchronous program, each statement or function executes immediately after the previous function returns. In an asynchronous program, however, this is not necessarily true. This is normally achieved through event handlers, functions that are triggered when something special happens. This means two things: First, a program is free to "go do other things" while a function is executing. The "return" event handler will
    be executed whenever that function returns. Second, in the case of a server or user interface, the program doesn't have to continually check if something has happened. Whenever an important event happens (Like a request), the appropriate event handler is called.</li>
</ul>
<p>As cool as that is, those abilities actually have nothing with me using Tornado. I just like the templating language. Stupid reason? Probably. But the CMS is functional, so whatever. Well, what's so great about this language?
</p>
<h3>Templating Basics</h3>
<p><h4>Statements</h4>
A statement is surrounded by {{!}}. Any vaild python expression will work in these brackets. For example, the statement {{![i**2 for i in range(0, 4)]}} generates {{[i**2 for i in range(0, 4)]}}, as you might expect. While this is a simple example, this could easily be used to do more complicated things, such as display load times or interact with databases. Because these templates are compiled into actual python code, and not just interpreted as a subset of python, the limits are nearly
endless. As an actually useful application, you loaded this page at {{datetime.datetime.today().strftime("%x, %X")}}<br/>
<h4>Directives</h4>
A directive is surrounded in {%!%}. While statements must return a value (Would work in a print() statement), directives provide most of the constructs that statements can't provide. These include things like if blocks, for loops, imports, or try-except-finally blocks. This means that, at least in theory, you could define complex behaviors in a Tornado template.</p>
<p>By no means is this a comprehensive, or even half decent, coverage of Tornado's capabilities. Tornado is also capable of serving websockets, along with being mostly modular meaning that for the most part, you can use as much or as little of the Tornado library as you want. If you want to really learn Tornado, look through the <a href="http://www.tornadoweb.org/en/stable/">documentation</a>. It's half decent, and provides a few examples. And if you want help, leave a comment or send me an
email. I'll get back to you.</p>
