I would imagine this band to play some sort of post-grunge rock

### Avant Garde [<small>French, "advance guard", "vanguard", literally "fore-guard"</small>][1]


*(At least to me)*, by definition, the concept of Avant Garde in art
cannot be readily defined. The very concept is to question and challenge
our ideas and definitions of society, theology, and life at large. Along
these lines, the Dadaist movement was an extremely avant-garde movement.
In the early 20th century, as the world became more industrialized and
technologically advanced, the definition of art and the intent of the world
began to be questioned by a few artists. These artists began redefining
their form, stretching the limits of what could be called art, growing
into the Dadaist movement. While other art forms of the time were driving
to create more realistic works of art, the Dadaists stated while the works
of art at that time sought to appeal and conform, art should offend and question.

When Peter Burger stated asserted that art was losing its autonomy, and
moving towards art becoming a praxis of life, he was referring to the
times' capitalization of art and entertainment. At the time, Avant Gardists
saw art art moving towards centralized concepts of aesthetics, rather than
making statements, or expressing an artist's opinions. To counter this,
the Avant Garde movement posited that the ideology of an artwork mattered
more than its conventional aesthetics. In a way, movements like Duchamp's
readymade phase was an attempt to show that art should have a greater
meaning than "It looks pretty." By "creating" works of art that fit into
neither conventional senses of aesthetics or meaning, Duchamp served to
question the purpose and definition of art in his time period.
