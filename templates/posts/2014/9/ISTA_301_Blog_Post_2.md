## Fluxus and Cybernetic Art

*Good Morning, Mr. Orwell* was a video art work that is widely recognized as the first international
satellite "installation." This work was produced by Nam June Paik, a South Korean born cybernetic and
fluxus artist, in response to George Orwell's dystopian visions of the future. The installation
consisted of a live showing of the audiovisual works of several artists from around the world,
synced into near-realtime using satelite connections between WNET TV in New York, the Centre Pompidou
in Paris, and several other broadcasters in Germany and South Korea.

This work shared several attributes with art movements of Paik's time, such as fluxism. Aspects such
as the work's live, untested, experimental nature leading to unforeseen technical issues contributed
to the performance's fluxus feel. Similarly, the event mixed various types of media, from comparitively
traditional musical peices, to experimenting with the side effects of the satellite media itself,
from the distortion introduced to the inherit delay of the satellite feed. Additionally, much was
done with video effects, and pre-processing of the feed.
