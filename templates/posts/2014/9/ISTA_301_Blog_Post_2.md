## Fluxus and Cybernetic Art

*Good Morning, Mr. Orwell* was a video art work that is widely recognized as the first international
satellite "installation." This work was produced by Nam June Paik, a South Korean born cybernetic and
fluxus artist, in response to George Orwell's dystopian visions of the future. The installation
consisted of a live showing of the audiovisual works of several artists from around the world,
synced into near-realtime using satelite connections between WNET TV in New York, the Centre Pompidou
in Paris, and several other broadcasters in Germany and South Korea.

This work shared several attributes with art movements of Paik's time, such as fluxism. Aspects such
as the work's live, untested, experimental nature leading to unforeseen technical issues contributed
to the performance's fluxus feel. Similarly, the event mixed various types of media, from comparitively
traditional musical peices, to experimenting with the side effects of the satellite media itself,
from the distortion introduced to the inherit delay of the satellite feed. Additionally, much was
done with video effects, and pre-processing of the feed.

In addition to creating Fluxus works, Nam June Paik also had a heavy influence in the Cybernetic movement.
Considered one of the pioneers of the Video Art medium, Paik became well known for making robots out of
television sets. Additionaly, he created quite a few works involving video feeds, realtime video
manipulation, and closed-circuit television. Among these works are pieces such as *Something Pacific*,
one of his first permanent outdoor installation, consisting of several sculptures of Buddahs paired
with ruined televisions, and contrasted with a bank of video feeds in the location's lobby; and
*One Candle, Candle Projection*, which consisted of a video feed of a single candle, split up into
its composite colors, manipulated, and projected onto the walls of the gallery. The entirety of both
these works relies on the concept of the use and manipulation of feedback loops present within the
works, demonstrating a cybernetic influence.

Based on these works, the concept of data manipulation and technology seems to be an overarching concept
throughout Paik's works. Paik was very interested in the concepts and impacts of the growing presence
of telecommunications frameworks, being one of the first to coin the term "Telecommunications highway."
Paik stated,

> "The building of new electronic super highways will become an even huger enterprise. Assuming we connect
> New York with Los Angeles by means of an electronic telecommunication network that operates in strong
> transmission ranges, as well as with continental satellites, wave guides, bundled coaxial cable, and
> later also via laser beam fiber optics: the expenditure would be about the same as for a Moon landing,
> except that the benefits in term of by-products would be greater."

In many ways, Paik seemed to want to encourage and accelerate this environment, and as works such as
*Good Morning, Mr. Orwell* demonstrated, belived that the furthering of these technologies would benifit
society as a whole.
